			<h4>John & Karen</h4>
			<h5>The Book Room Collective</h5>
			<p>Despite our best efforts to remain in the technological dark ages in the company of the other computer illiterates, itac.technology has gently guided us towards tomorrow. Our computers now offer support rather than frustration. We have on-hand back up for hardware, software and data. A person answers the phone when we are in trouble. Most importantly we have learnt to turn it off and then on again.</p>

			<h4>John & Jill</h4>
			<h5>Byron Quarter</h5>
			<p>Through the platinum partnership with itac.technology, all our technology needs are taken care of. Over our time working together Sam and the team have become our first call for any question no matter how small or any larger project from new office technology fit outs to improving our guest wifi network.</p>

			<h5>Bluewater On The Beach</h5>
			<p>The ongoing, priority support we receive from itac.technology is invaluable. It's nice to be able to pick up the phone or send an email and get a fast, local response. The intimate understanding of our business that they have built up over the years save us so much time, money and stress as they have taken the time to get to know us and the business inside out. It's like having an internal IT department, without the internal IT department costs!</p>

			<h4>Jane</h4>
			<h5>Byron Bay Luxury Weddings</h5>
			<p>Sam and the itac.technology team have been a substantial help to me with the IT side of our business as this was not at all a strong point or what I do. I am a great believer of getting the experts to do the jobs you can't and itac.technology definitely took our business on board and assisted me where the help was needed. As someone who likes to work have a local to do business with, this was very important that we could engage with someone that was local and someone we could connect with at any time.</p>
