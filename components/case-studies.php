		<h2>Accomodation Providers</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The client - has a number of properties throughout Belongil and Byron Bay</li>
			<li>The problem - they can’t be on location at every location all the time so required a way to monitor one of satellite properties for security and safety</li>
			<li>The solution - ITAC installed high definition IP surveillance camera system on location, accessible remotely from owner’s iPhone</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>The client - runs a 200 bed dorm room accommodation property in central Byron Bay</li>
			<li>The problem - the guests demand Internet connectivity more than they demand clean bedding and the wireless hotspot system combined with Byron’s dated Internet infrastructure wasn’t performing</li>
			<li>The solution - ITAC overhauled the Unifi Wireless Hotspot system and upgraded then aggregated three ADSL2 Internet lines to manage the high demands of peak season resulting in a 99% network coverage and uptime for the property with guess complaints down to zero.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>The client - has an established, high-end boutique accommodation in central Byron Bay</li>
			<li>The problem - in the 14 plus years of ownership, they’ve never been able to provide consistent Internet connection to each guest room and receive constant complaints</li>
			<li>The solution - within 1 hour, ITAC surveyed the premises, located existing wiring that could be repurposed to carry network data and installed dedicated access points to each room wired back to a central comms cabinet. As a random bonus, we also leveraged our local network of contacts and arranged a plumber to redo their guttering!</li>
